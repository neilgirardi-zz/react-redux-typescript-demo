**Quick Setup:**

* ```$ git clone  git@github.com:neilgirardi/react-redux-typescript-demo.git```
* ```$ cd  react-redux-typescript-demo```
* copy your .env file to the root directory of the project:
    * (the .env file should contain a variable called ```API_KEY``` with a valid New York Times API key)
* ```$ npm run setup```
    * this will install node modules in the root of the project directory as well as in the frontend and backend directories
* ```$ npm run start```
    * this will spin up a frontend development server on port ```:3000``` and a backend development server on port ```:3001```
    * (please make sure you do not have any other processes running on those ports )
    * Your default browser should open a new tab pointing to ```http://localhost:3000/``` with the application running.
    
**Enjoy!**
